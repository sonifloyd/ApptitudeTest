  # A television manufacturing company has decided to increase the sale to beat the economic slowdown. 
  It decides to reduce the price of television sets by 25% as a result of which the sales increased by 20%.
  What is the effect on the total revenue of the company?
  Let the initial Price = Rs.100 and initial sales = 100
So, the initial revenue = Rs. 10000
Now, the price is reduced to 25% which is equal to Rs.75 and Sales is increased by 20% which is equal to 120.
Now new revenue = 120 x 75 = Rs. 9000
Change in revenue = (10000 - 9000) = Rs.1000 decrease
% decrease = (1000/10000) x 100 = 10%
Hence, the correct option is decrease of 10%.
#Ravi has a bag full of 10 Nestle and 5 Cadbury chocolates. Out of these, he draws two chocolates. 
What is the probability that he would get at least one Nestle chocolate?
Probability of getting atleast one nestle chocolate = [(10C1 x 5C1) + 10C2] / 15C2
[(10 x 5) + (10 x 9)/2] / [(15 x 14)/2] = 19/21.
Hence, the required probability is 19/21.
# The value of y in logy1369y = 3 is:
logy1369y = 3
=> logyy + loyy1369= 3
=> 1 + logy1369 = 3
=> 1369 = y2
=> y = 37
#T he causes of productivity loss are to be written around a circle in the annual report. 
In how many ways can an analyst write them around the circle, if the number of causes are 5?
Here, the clockwise and anticlockwise orders are different.
In this case the number of circular arrangement will be (n - 1)! = (5 - 1)! = 4!
# What is the least perfect square, which is divisible by 24, 30 and 60?
	L.C.M of the given numbers =120= 23 x 3 x 5.
Thus, to make it a perfect square it should be multiplied by 2 , 3 and 5 which gives 24 x 32 x 52  = 3600(perfect square).
# An aeroplane flies along the sides of an equilateral triangle with speed of 300 km/hr, 200 km/hr, 240 km/hr. 
The average speed of the plane while flying around the triangle is:
The average speed when three speeds are given x km/hr , y km/hr, z km/hr and equal distance travelled â€¦
= (3xyz / xy + yz + xz)
= [(3 x 300 x 200 x 240)] / [(300 x 200 + 200 x 240 + 300 x 240)]
= 240 km/hr
# Three successive discounts of 6%, 10%, 15% are equal to a single discount of
Let us assume the marked price is Rs.100.After three successive discounts,it becomes 100*0.9*0.85*0.94=Rs.71.91.This is equal to a single discount of 28.09%.
Alternate method
Successive Discount = a + b -(ab / 100)
Let us take -10 % & -15 % = - 23.5% (using the formula)
And finally we should take -23.5% & -6% = -28.09 %( -ve shows discount )
# A certain sum of money amounts to Rs. 2,500 in 
a span of 5 years and further to Rs. 3,000 in a span of 7 years at simple interest. The sum is:(sum means principle)
We know, Amount = SI + P
Just equate in equation.
2500 = 5rp + p...........(1)
3000 = 7rp + p...........(2)
pr=25,000........(3)
Substituting (3) in (1) or (2) we get 
P = Rs. 1250
Hence, the required sum is Rs.1250.
# When the price of a pair of shoes is decreased by 10%, the number of pairs sold increased by 20%. What is the net effect on sales?
	Let the initial Price = Rs.100 and number of shoes sold = 100
So, total sales = Rs. 10000
Now, the price is reduced to 10% which is equal to Rs.90 and number of shoes sold increases by 20% which is equal to Rs.120.
Now new total sales = 120 x 90 = Rs. 10800
Change in revenue = (10800 - 10000) = Rs.800 increase
% increase = (800/10000) x 100 = 8%
Hence, the correct option is increase of 8%.
# Ronald and Elan are working on an assignment. Ronald takes 6 hours to type 32 pages on a computer, while Elan takes 5 hours to type 40 pages. How much time will they take, working together on two different computers to type an assignment of 110 pages ?
	In 1hr, Ronald types = 32/6 pages and Elan types = 40/5 pages
If they work together they will type = 32/6 + 40/5 = 40/3 pages in 1 hr
Time needed  to complete the assignment is = (3 x 110)/40 = 33/4 = 8hrs 15mins
Hence, the time required is 8 hrs 15 mins.
# An investment earns 4 paisa per rupee invested. If at the end of the year, the interest earned by an investment is Rs. 100, then the investment is equal to:
	Going through the options, 2500 x 4 = 10000 paise = Rs. 100 
This is the only option which satisfies the given criteria.
Hence, 2500 is the correct option.
