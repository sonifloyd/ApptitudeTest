# Formula
CUBOID

Let length = l, breadth = b and height = h units. Then

Volume = (l x b x h) cubic units.

Surface area = 2(lb + bh + lh) sq. units.

Diagonal = l2 + b2 + h2 units.

CUBE

Let each edge of a cube be of length a. Then,

Volume = a3 cubic units.

Surface area = 6a2 sq. units.

Diagonal = 3a units.

CYLINDER

Let radius of base = r and Height (or length) = h. Then,

Volume = (r2h) cubic units.

Curved surface area = (2rh) sq. units.

Total surface area = 2r(h + r) sq. units.

CONE

Let radius of base = r and Height = h. Then,

Slant height, l = h2 + r2 units.

Volume = r2h cubic units.

Curved surface area = (rl) sq. units.

Total surface area = (rl + r2) sq. units.

SPHERE

Let the radius of the sphere be r. Then,

Volume = r3 cubic units.

Surface area = (4r2) sq. units.

HEMISPHERE

Let the radius of a hemisphere be r. Then,

Volume = r3 cubic units.

Curved surface area = (2r2) sq. units.

Total surface area = (3r2) sq. units.

Note: 1 litre = 1000 cm3.
# A right triangle with sides 3 cm, 4 cm and 5 cm is rotated the side of 3 cm to form a cone. 
The volume of the cone so formed is:
so b=3,p=4,h=5
then we rotate tringle to form a cone r=3,p=height=4,l=5
volume of cone = 1/3*pi*r*r*h=12pi
#  A hollow iron pipe is 21 cm long and its external diameter is 8 cm. If the thickness of the pipe is 1 cm and 
iron weighs 8 g/cm3,
then the weight of the pipe is:
External radius = 4 cm,

Internal radius = 3 cm.

Volume of iron	
=		22/7	x [(4)2 - (3)2] x 21	cm3

=		22/7	x 7 x 1 x 21	cm3

= 462 cm3.
 Weight of iron = (462 x 8) gm = 3696 gm = 3.696 kg.
 # 66 cubic centimetres of silver is drawn into a wire 1 mm in diameter. The length of the wire in metres will be:
 Let the length of the wire be h.

Radius =	1/2	mm	=	1/20	cm.	Then,

	22/7	x	1/20	x	1/20	x h = 66.

 h =		66 x 20 x 20 x 7	/22	= 8400 cm = 84 m.
# A boat having a length 3 m and breadth 2 m is floating on a lake. The boat sinks by 1 cm when a man gets on it.
The mass of the man is:
Volume of water displaced	= (3 x 2 x 0.01) m3
= 0.06 m3.
 Mass of man	= Volume of water displaced x Density of water
= (0.06 x 1000) kg
= 60 kg.
# 50 men took a dip in a water tank 40 m long and 20 m broad on a religious day. If the average displacement of water 
by a man is 4 m3,
then the rise in the water level in the tank will be:
Total volume of water displaced = (4 x 50) m3 = 200 m3.

 Rise in water level =		200	m /(40*20)=0.25 m = 25 cm.
 # The slant height of a right circular cone is 10 m and its height is 8 m. Find the area of its curved surface.
 l = 10 m,

h = 8 m.

So, r = l2 - h2 = (10)2 - 82 = 6 m.

 Curved surface area = pirl = ( 22/7x 6 x 10) m2 = 60 m2.
