The debate over the moves by the Central and the Jammu and Kashmir governments to resettle Kashmiri Pandits in Kashmir is 
one that will only bring pain to any well-wisher of the State. To understand this, one has to go back in time, when the 
second half of the 1980s saw Kashmir spiral out of control, gripped by violence, suspicion and dread. What had begun as an
ethnic conflict was soon imparted a religious colour by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The Pandits, a Hindu 
minority in the Kashmir Valley, were targeted by the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), even though the organisation 
had sought to build on the original secular foundations of the National Conference, and by the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, a 
secessionist outfit, which sparked their exodus. By 2008, their population, as assessed by the Kashmiri Pandit Sangharsh 
Samiti (KPSS), was reduced to 651 families from 75,343 families on January 1, 1990. Nearly 70,000 families fled in the 
turmoil of 1990-92, and even though the violence was brought under control, most of the remaining families left thereafter.
By 1990 — I was Special Commissioner, Anantnag, in South Kashmir then — the public had ceased to visit government offices. 
But in early March, several hundred people from the Nai Basti neighbourhood went to the Special Commissioner’s office in 
Khannabal demanding to see me. Because of the disturbed circumstances, I had set up office and residence in the rest house 
in the district headquarters. Mohammad Syed Shah, generally known as Syed Shah, the brother of the separatist leader, Shabbir 
Shah, and Muslim United Front (MUF) member of the dissolved State Assembly, demanded to know why Pandits were leaving en 
masse and in turn why the administration was doing nothing about it. Mr. Shah accused the administration of encouraging 
the migration so that the Army would be left free to unleash its heavy artillery on all habitations. When I asked the 
delegation if it believed that I would be party to such a plan, this was their response: ‘I had been kept in the dark, 
while they were privy to “secret” information’. That the Pandits were apprehensive was hardly surprising, I said. Places 
of worship, like the one in Anantnag, where the majority went, were being used to issue threats to them over loudspeakers.
I learnt later that these inflammatory sermons, and their reverberating public applause, were audio recordings circulated 
to mosques to be played over loudspeakers at prayer time. Local Muslims needed to reassure the Pandits of their safety, 
I said. The administration would provide security whenever a threat to the Pandits was anticipated, but how effective it 
would all be would depend on unstinted public support, given that the residences of the Pandits were scattered. 
The gathering concurred and dispersed. I requested State Governor Jagmohan that he appeal to the Pandits, in a telecast, 
that they stay on in Kashmir, and assure them of their safety on the basis of the assurances of the Anantnag residents. 
Unfortunately, the only announcement to this effect was that “refugee” camps were being set up in every district, and 
Pandits who felt threatened could move to them rather than leave the Valley. Pandits in service who felt threatened were 
free to leave their stations; they would continue to be paid their salaries. I relate this story because the present 
flurry of allegations brings a sense of de-ja-vu. The Pandits — more than 1,20,000 in the early 1980s — numbered about
7,000 in the Kashmir Valley, in 2005.
