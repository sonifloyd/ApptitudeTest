Three gold coins of weight 780gm, 840gm and 960gm are cut into small pieces, all of which have the equal weight.
Each piece must be heavy as possible. If one such piece is shared by two persons, then how many persons are needed to
give all the pieces of gold coins?

HCF(780,840,960)=60 
Thus, total number of pieces:
⇒780/60+840/60+960/60=13+14+16=43
Total number of person required =43×2= 86.
