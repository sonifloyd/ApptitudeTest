# A can do a work in 15 days and B in 20 days. If they work on it together for 4 days, then the fraction of the work 
that is left is :
A.	1/4
B.	1/10
C.	7/15
D.	8/15
Explanation :
Work done by A in 1 day = 1/15 and

work done by B in 1 day =  1/20.

Work done by A and B together in 1 day = 1/15 + 1/20 = 7/60.

Work done by A and together in 4 days = 4 * 7/60 = 7/15.

So fraction of work left after 4 days = 1 - 7/15 = 8/15.
 
 # In what ratio must wheat at Rs.3.20 per kg be mixed with wheat at Rs.2.90 per kg so that the mixture be worth Rs.3.08 per kg?
A.	3:4
B.	1:2
C.	3:2
D.	4:3
Explanation :
C.P of a unit quantity of 1st kind  = Rs. 3.20
C.P of a unit quantity of 2nd kind  = Rs. 2.90
Mean price = Rs.3.08





C.P of unit quantity         C.P of unit quantity

of 1st kind                         of 2nd kind

    (Rs. 3.20)                         (Rs. 2.90)

                   \                       /
                       Mean Price


                         (Rs.3.08)

                    /                        \

  (3.08 – 2.90)          :           (3.20 – 3.08)

       0.18                                      0.12

Hence, the required ratio = 0.18 : 0.12 = 3 : 2.

# A noodles merchant buys two varieties of noodles the price of the first being twice that of the second.
He sells the mixture at Rs 17.50 per kilogram thereby making a profit of 25%. If the ratio of the amounts of 
the first noodles and the second noodles in the mixture is 2:3, then the respective costs of each noodles are :-
A.	Rs 20, Rs 10
B.	Rs 24, Rs 12
C.	Rs 16, Rs 8
D.	Rs 26, Rs 13
Explanation :
Let, the price of one noodles = k.

And, the price of the other noodle = k/2.

Price of 1 kg = (2k/5) + (3/5) × (k/2) = 7k/10.

The C.P. of noodles = 17.50 × (100/125) = 14.

=> 7k/10=14.

=> k=20.

So, the price of the noodles are 20 and 10.
# Two students appeared at an examination. One of them secured 9 marks more than the other and his marks was 56% of the sum of their marks. What are the marks obtained by them?
A.	42, 33
B.	42, 36
C.	44, 33
D.	44, 36
Explanation :
Let the marks secured by them be x and (x + 9).

Then sum of their marks = x + (x + 9) = 2x + 9.

Given that (x + 9) was 56% of the sum of their marks.

=> (x+9) =(56/100)(2x+9).

=> (x+9) =(14/25)(2x+9).

=> 25x + 225 = 28x + 126.

=> 3x = 99.

=> x = 33.

Then (x + 9) = 33 + 9 = 42.

Hence their marks are 33 and 42.

# Rahul went to a shop and bought things worth Rs. 25, out of which 30 Paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 6%, then what was the cost of the tax free items?
A.	Rs 15
B.	Rs 12.10
C.	Rs 19.70
D.	Rs 16.80
Explanation :
Let the cost of the tax items = x

Given that tax rate = 6%

Cost of tax items, x*(6/100) = 30/100

x = 5 rs

Now non taxable item = total cost - cost for taxable item - tax

= 25 - 5 - 0.30

=19.70


# Average age of students of an adult school is 40 years. 120 new students whose average age is 32 years joined the school. As a result the average age is decreased by 4 years. Find the number of students of the school after joining of the new students.
A.	1200
B.	120
C.	360
D.	240
Explanation :
Let the original no. of students be x.
According to situation, 40x + 120*32 = (x + 120)36

=> x = 120.
So, Required no. of students after joining the new students
= x + 120 = 240.


# The average of two numbers is P. If one number is Q, then the other number is
A.	2Q
B.	2P
C.	P - Q
D.	2P - Q
Explanation :
Let the other number be x, 

According to the question, 

=> ( x + Q ) / 2 = P.

=> x + Q = 2P.

=> x = 2P - Q.

Hence, the required number is 2P - Q.


# Ten years ago, P was half of Q in age. If the ratio of their present ages is 3:4, what will be the total of their present ages?
A.	30
B.	35
C.	40
D.	45
Explanation :
Let the present age of P and Q be 3x and 4x respectively.
Ten years ago, P was half of Q in age.
=> (3x - 10) = (4x - 10)/2.
=> 6x - 20 = 4x - 10.



=> 2x = 10.
=> x = 5
Total of their present ages = 3x + 4x = 7x = 7 * 5 = 35.


#  Present ages of Sameer and Anand are in the ratio of 5 : 4 respectively. Three years hence, the ratio of their ages will become 11 : 9 respectively. What is Anand's present age in years?
A.	33 years
B.	24 years
C.	11 years
D.	30 years
Explanation :
Given, the present ratio of the ages of Sameer and Anand is 5:4.

Let (Age of Sameer)/5 = (Age of Anand)/4 = x.

Present age of Sameer = 5x 

Present age of Anand = 4x 

After 3 years,

Age of Sameer woud be 5x+3

Age of Anand woud be 4x+3

S,o (5x + 3)/ (4x + 3) = 11/9.

=> x = 6

Hence age of Anand will be 24 years.

# The sum of ages of 5 children born at the intervals of 3 years each is 50 years. What is the age of the youngest child?

A.	
4 years

B.	
8 years

C.	
10 years

D.	
None of these

Explanation :
Let the ages of children be x, (x + 3), (x + 6), (x + 9) and (x + 12) years.

Then, x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + (x + 9) + (x + 12) = 50.

=> 5x = 20.

=> x = 4.

Hence,   Age of the youngest child = x = 4 years.

# A person's present age is two-fifth of the age of his mother. After 8 years, he will be one-half of the age of his mother. How old is the mother at present ?
A.	38
B.	40
C.	42
D.	44
Explanation :
Let the mother's present age be x years.
Then, the person's present age = (2/5)x years.

 => 2[(2/5)x + 40 ] = (1/2)[x + 8]. 
 => x = 40

# 3, 10, 101,?

A.	
10101

B.	
10201

C.	
10202

D.	
11012

Explanation :
Each term in the series is obtained by adding 1 to the square of the preceding term.

# In the series 2, 6, 18, 54, ...... what will be the 8th term ?
A.	4370
B.	4374
C.	7443
D.	7434
Explanation :
Clearly, 2 x 3 = 6, 6 x 3 = 18, 18 x 3 = 54, ...............

So, the series is a G.P. in which a = 2, r = 3.

Therefore, 8th term = ar8-1 = ar7 = 2 x 37 = (2 x 2187) = 4374.

# If A is the brother of B; B is the sister of C; and C is the father of D, how D is related to A?
A.	Brother
B.	Sister
C.	Nephew
D.	Cannot be determined
Explanation :
If D is Male, the answer is Nephew.

If D is Female, the answer is Niece.

As the sex of D is not known, hence, the relation between D and A cannot be determined.

Note:

Niece - A daughter of one's brother or sister, or of one's brother-in-law or sister-in-law.

Nephew - A son of one's brother or sister, or of one's brother-in-law or sister-in-law.



So, missing term = (101)2 + 1 = 10202.

# If A + B means A is the brother of B; A - B means A is the sister of B and A x B means A is the father of B. Which of the following means that C is the son of M?
A.	M - N x C + F
B.	F - C + N x M
C.	N + M - F x C
D.	M x N - C + F
Explanation :
M x N → M is the father of N

N - C → N is the sister of C

and C + F → C is the brother of F.

Hence, M is the father of C or C is the son of M.

# 125,80,45,20,?
A.	5
B.	8
C.	10
D.	12
Explanation :
The pattern is - 45, - 35, - 25, .....

So, missing term = 20 - 15 = 5.
