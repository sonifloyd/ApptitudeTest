Directions (1-3)- Read the following passage and answer the questions as directed. 

It is by now close to 50 years since Indira Gandhi brought the idea of eradicating poverty into the electoral arena in India.
‘Garibi Hatao’ had been her slogan. She actually took the country some distance in the promised direction. 
Though it had not come close to being eradicated in her time, it was under her leadership that the reduction in poverty 
commenced, in the late 1960s. And it was under her leadership again that the reduction accelerated, in the early 1980s. 
This is not surprising for she was a pragmatic politician and took pride in being Indian. While the last attribute motivated 
her to improve the condition of her people, the first left her aware of the centrality of income generation in poverty 
eradication.

The role that income generation actually played in lowering poverty in India may be gauged from the facts that economic 
growth had surged in the 1980s, and the late 1960s was when agricultural production quickened as the Green Revolution 
progressed.

So, if there had been a focus on poverty even 50 years ago, why have we not seen it end? This is because the approach 
of public policy to the problem has been to initiate schemes which could serve as no more than a palliative, as suggested by 
the very term ‘poverty alleviation’ commonly used in the discourse of this time. These schemes failed to go to the root 
of poverty, which is capability deprivation that leaves an individual unable to earn sufficient income through work or 
entrepreneurship.

 Capability Possession
 Capability deprivation

 Poverty Alleviation

 This is not the case in India, where the task of creating the wherewithal for providing public services has not even been seriously initiated.
 Income poverty is a manifestation of the deprivation, and focussing exclusively on the income shortfall can address only the symptom.
 A discernible pattern is that the southern and western regions of India have lower poverty than the northern, central and eastern ones.
 There is a crucial role for services, of both producer and consumer variety, in eliminating the capability deprivation that is poverty.

"Income poverty is a manifestation of the deprivation and focussing exclusively on the income shortfall can address only the symptom." will be the next line after the last line of the passage. It becomes a concluding statement to the respective paragraph.
