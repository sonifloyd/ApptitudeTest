# Q1. The LCM and HCF of two numbers are 240 and 16 respectively. If two numbers are in the ratio 3: 5, then the bigger 
number is:
 90
 85
 70
 80
 75
Solution:                                                       pdt of two no=hcf*lcm
Suppose two numbers are 3x and 5x Then, 3x×5x=HCF×240
⇒ 15x²=16×240
⇒ x²=256
⇒ x=16
So, the numbers are
3x = 3×16 = 48 and 5x × 16 = 80
# Six bells commence tolling together and toll at the intervals of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 seconds respectively, in 60 min. 
 How many times do they toll together?
 17
 15
 13
 19
 11
Solution:
lcm(5,10,15,20,25,30)=300sec=5min
60/5+1=13
# Find the greatest possible length which can be used to measure 4 m 3 cm, 4 m 34 cm and 4 m 65 cm exactly.
hcf of numbers
# The L.C.M. of two numbers is 48. The numbers are in the ratio of 2: 3. Find sum of numbers.
2x*3x=48
sum 40
 # Find the least number which when divided by 10, 11, 15 and 22 leaves 3, 4, 8 and 15 as remainders, respectively.
10-3=7
11-4=7
15-8=7
so on cd=7
lcm (10,11,15,22,)-cd=ans
# In four consecutive prime numbers that are in ascending order, the product of the first three is 385 and that of the last
three is 1001. The largest given prime number is:
abc=385
bcd=1001
h.c.f=bc
d=bcd/bc
# The average of first nine integral multiples of ‘3’ is:
3(1+2+....+9)/9=15
