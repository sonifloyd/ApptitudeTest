#In a group of ducks and cows, the total numbers of legs are 14 more than twice the number of heads. Find the total number of cows.
	14 7 21 8
	Let the number of ducks be d and number of cows be ’c’.
Then, total number of legs = 2d + 4c = 2(d + 2c)
Total number of heads = c + d.
Given that total numbers of legs are 14 more than twice the number of heads.
=> 2(d + 2c) = 14 + 2(c + d).
=> 2d + 4c = 14 + 2c + 2d.
=> 2c = 14
=> c = 7
i.e., total number of cows = 7
