# The length of the bridge, which a train 130 metres long and travelling at 45 km/hr can cross in 30 seconds, is:
A.	200 meters
B.	225 meters
C.	245 meters
D.	250 meters
Explanation :
Given, Length of the train = 130 meters

Speed of the train = 45 km/hr = 45 * (5/18) m/sec =25 / 2 m/sec

Time = 30 secs

Let the length of the bridge be x meters .

The distance travelled by the train while crossing the bridge will be sum of the length of train and Length of the bridge = (x+130) meters

so ,

=> 25/2 = (x + 120)/ 30.

=> 30*25 = 2x + 260.

=> 750 - 260 = 2x.

=> 490 = 2x.

=> x = 245 meters.

# 50 meters long train crosses a bridge of length 250 meters in 30 seconds. Find the time for train to cross a platform of 130 meters?
A.	18 sec
B.	23 sec
C.	24 sec 
D.	28 sec 
Explanation :
Lenth of Train = 50 meters

Lenth of Bridge = 250 meters

Time taken by train to cross the bridge = 30 secs

So , distance traveled by train to cross the bridge is sum of the length of the train and length of bridge.

Speed of the train = (50 + 250)/ 30st = 10 m/sec

Now time taken by train to cross the platform of length 130 meters will be

=> T = (50 + 130)/ 10

=> 18 seconds.

# If 3y + x > 2 and x + 2y <= 3 , What can be said about the value of y?
A.	y=1
B.	y>1
C.	y>-2
D.	y>-1
Explanation :
3y + x > 2                                                      --------------------(1)
x + 2y < = 3


=> x + 2y + y < = 3 + y

=> x + 3y < = 3 + y                                      ---------------------(2)

From (1)&(2)
2 <  3y + x < 3 + y


=>      2 < 3 + y

=>     -1 < y

=>      y > -1

Hence (D) is the correct answer.

# A can lay railway track between two given stations in 16 days and B can do the same job in 12 days. With help of C, they did the job in 4 days only. Then, C alone can do the job in:
A.	46/5 days
B.	47/5 days
C.	48/5 days
D.	10 days
Explanation :
Work done by A in 1 day = 1/16

Work done by B in 1 day = 1/12

Let C takes x days to lay railway track between two given stations.

So work done by C in 1 day = 1/x

A, B and C together take 4 days to lay the railway track.

So, In 1 day they complete 14 of the total work together

So, 1/16 + 1/12 + 1/x =  1/4.

=> 1/x = 1/4 - 1/16 - 1/12

=> 1/x = 5/48.

=> x = 48/5.

# Out of 40 consecutive integers, two are chosen at random. Find the probability that their sum is odd?
A.	21/40
B.	19/39
C.	21/39
D.	20/39
Explanation :
Forty consecutive integers will have 20 even and 20 odd integers. The sum of 2 chosen integers will be odd, only if:

First is even and second is odd
First is odd and second is even
Mathematically the probability will be given by:

P(First is even) * P(Second is odd) + P(First is odd) * P(Second is even)

= (20/40) * (20/39) + (20/40) * (20/39)

= 20/39.

# When four dice are thrown, what is the probability that the same number appears on each of them ?
A.	1/36
B.	1/18
C.	1/216
D.	1/5
Explanation :
When four dice are rolled the total no of outcomes are : 64

All dice show up same number in the following cases: (1,1,1,1), (2,2,2,2), (3,3,3,3), (4,4,4,4), (5,5,5,5), (6,6,6,6).

So in above six cases, all dice will show up the same number.

Required probability: 6/64 = 1/216.

# In an examination, a girl's average marks were 57 per paper. If she had obtained 10 more marks for her Maths paper and 5 more marks for her English paper, her average per paper would have been 60. How many papers were there in the examination?
A.	3
B.	9
C.	10
D.	5
Explanation :
Let the number of papers be x.
Then, 57x + 10+5 = 60x.
=> 60x-57x = 15.
=> 3x = 15.
=>   x = 5.

# n june a baseball team that played 60 games had won 30% of its game played. After a phenomenal winning streak this team raised its average to 50% .How many games must the team have won in a row to attain this average?

A.	
20

B.	
30

C.	
24

D.	
12

Explanation :
Number of matches won by the team in June: 30% of 60 = 18

After a phenomenal winning streak the average is 50%

Let the team played x matches continuously and won all of them to achieve an average winning percentage of 50%.

So total matches played by the team = (60+x)

Total matches won by the team = (18+x)

Total matches won = 50% of Total matches played

=> (18+x) = 50% of (60+x).

=> 18+x = (50/100)*(60+x).

=> 18+x =(1/2)*(60+x).

=> 36+2x = 60+x.

=> x = 24.

###LOGICAL
A father said to his son, "I was as old as you are at the present at the time of your birth". If the father's age is 38 years now, the son's age five years back was:

A.	
14 years

B.	
19 years

C.	
33 years

D.	
38 years

Explanation :
Let the son's present age be x years.

Then, (38 - x) = x.

=> 2x = 38.

=> x = 19.

Hence,  Son's age 5 years back (19 - 5) = 14 years.

# Sachin is younger than Rahul by 7 years. If the ratio of their ages is 7:9, Find the age of Sachin ? 
A.	24.5
B.	25.5
C.	26.5
D.	27.5
Explanation :
If Rahul age is x, then Sachin age is x - 7,
so, 
=> (x-7) / x = 7/9.
=> 9x - 63 = 7x. 
=> 2x = 63
 => x = 31.5.
So, Sachin age is 31.5 - 7 = 24.5.
