#In a group of ducks and cows, the total numbers of legs are 14 more than twice the number of heads. Find the total number of cows.
	14 7 21 8
	Let the number of ducks be d and number of cows be ’c’.
Then, total number of legs = 2d + 4c = 2(d + 2c)
Total number of heads = c + d.
Given that total numbers of legs are 14 more than twice the number of heads.
=> 2(d + 2c) = 14 + 2(c + d).
=> 2d + 4c = 14 + 2c + 2d.
=> 2c = 14
=> c = 7
i.e., total number of cows = 7
# Q2 The compound interest on a certain sum for 2 years at 20% per annum is Rs.176. The simple interest on the same sum for double the time at half the rate percent per annum is
	160 400 600 800
	Let the Sum be ’P’.
Given, P(1 + 20/100)2 - P = 176
Solving for P, we get P = 400.               # c.I=p[(1+r/100)^t-1)]
Now, P = 400, T = 4 years, R = 10%           # A=P(1+R/100)^T
S.I = (400 x 4 x 10) / 100 = 160              C.I=A-P
Thus, the required simple interest is Rs.160.
# The average monthly salary of 12 operators and 3 managers in a factory was Rs. 830. When one of the manager whose salary was Rs. 900, was replaced with a new manager, then the average salary of the team went down to 800. What is the salary of the new manager?
	870 450 600 300
	The total salary amount = 15 × 830 = 12450
The salary of the exiting manager = 900.
Therefore, the salary of 12 operators and the remaining 2 managers :
= 12450 − 900 = 11550
When a new manager joins, the new average salary drops to Rs.800 for the total team of 15 of them.
The total salary for the 15 people i.e., 12 operators, 2 old managers and 1 new manager = 800 × 15 = 12000.
Therefore, the salary of the new manager is 12450 - 12000 = 450 less than that of the old manager who left the company, which is equal to 900 - 450 = 450.

Alternate method :

The average salary dropped by Rs.30 for 15 of them. Therefore, the overall salary has dropped by 15 × 30 = 450.
Therefore, the new manager’s salary should be Rs.300 less than that of the old manager = 900 − 450 = 450.
# From a pack of 52 cards, two cards are drawn together at random. What is the probability of both the cards being Queens?
	1/26 1/52 1/221 1/84
	Let S be the sample space. Then,
n(S) = 52C2 = (52 × 51)/(2 × 1)
= 1326.
Let E = event of getting 2 queens out of 4.
n(E) = 4C2 = (4 × 4)/(2 × 1)
= 6.
P(E) = n(E) / n(S)  = 6 / 1326
= 1/221.
# Let N = 10p78pq (7digit number). If N is exactly divisible by 120 then the sum of the digits in N is equal to:
	12 22 24 32
	Given N = 10p78pq is exactly divisible by 120.
Since the last digit of the dividend is 0, the last digit of N also should be 0.
Then obviously, q = 0.
i.e., N = 10p78p0
Now we have to find p.
We know 120 = 3 x 5 x 8 and 3, 5 and 8 are co-primes.
If N is divisible by 120 then it is divisible by 3, 5 and 8.
We know that, "If a number is divisible by 3 then the sum of its digits also divisible by 3"
Then, 1+ 0 + p + 7 + 8 + p + 0 = 16 + 2p
i.e., 16 + 2p must be divisible by 3
Then the possible values of p are 1,4,7,10,13 and so on
Since p is a digit, the possible values are 1, 4, 7
Now, N must be divisible by 8 also.
We know that, "If a number is divisible by 8 then its last 3 digits also divisible by 8"
Here 8p0 is a multiple of 8.
Now put all the above possible values of p then we have 8p0 = 810 or 840 or 870
From these, 840 is a multiple of 8.
Then the value of p = 4 and N = 1047840
Hence, the required sum = 1 + 0 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 4 + 0 = 24.
# Professor Shyam was talking to the students about 21st century which has started with a Monday. Incidently, he posed a question that the last day of the century cannot be
	Monday Tuesday Wednesday Friday
	When number of days in a given period of time is divided by 7 then the remainder which results represents the number of odd days.
To start with consider a span of 100 years. Every 4th year is a leap year within a century and every 4th century year is a leap year.
This means years 4,8,12 etc are leap years while 100 is not a leap year. 
But 400th year, 800th year etc are leap years.
By above argument 100 years contain 24 leap years and 76 non leap years. (Years 4,8,12....96 are leap years and 100th year is not. Therefore, number of leap years in 100 years is 100/4 - 1)
Number of days in 100 years = 24 x 366 + 76 x 365 = 36524
Dividing 36524 by 7, we will get a quotient of 5217 and remainder of 5.
Therefore, 100 years i.e., 36524 days has 5 odd days to end with. Since the century has started with monday, odd days in order will be Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu and Fri.
Last odd day will be the last day of the century. Hence, last day of 1st century will be Friday.
By similar ways one can find that 200 years will contain 3 odd days, 300 years will contain 1 odd day and 400 years will contain 0 odd days. 
This means last day of 2nd century will be Wednesday, last day of 3rd century will be Monday and last day of 4th century will be Sunday.
The entire cycle will repeat for the next 400 years, thereafter next 400 years and so on.
Therefore, last day of the century cannot be Tuesday, Thursday or Saturday.
# In a Xerox shop 2% discount is allowed on all photocopies done after first 1000 sheets. How much will it cost to copy 5000 sheets of paper if it costs Re. 1 to photocopy a sheet of paper?
	Rs.3920 Rs.4290 Rs.4920 Rs.3290
	Total cost   =   Rs. [1 x 1000 + (100 - 2)% of 1 x 4000]
= Rs. (1000 + 0.98 x 4000)
= Rs. (1000 + 3920)
= Rs. 4920.
# Steve wants to sell his scooter. There are two offers, one at Rs. 12,000 cash and the other a credit of Rs. 12,880 to be paid after 8 months, money being at 18% per annum. Which is the better offer?
	Rs.12000 cash Rs.12880 credit Both are good None is good
	18% per annum 
ie) for 12 months the rate of interest is 18%
for 4 months  the rate of interest is 6%
so for 8 months the rate of interest is 12%
The present worth of 12,880 (before 8 months) is 12,880/1.12=Rs.11,500
So when we compare the present worth of the two Rs.12,000 cash is better.
# Ronald Ross borrows Rs. 5000 for 2 years at 2% p.a. simple interest. Ronald immediately lends it to another person at 61/4 % p.a. for 2 years. What is his gain(in Rs) in the transaction per year?
	Rs.118.16 Rs.131.80 Rs.120.24 Rs.212.50
	Gain in 2 years  
= Rs. (5000  * 25/4 * 2) /100 - (5000* 2 * 2)/100                 
= Rs. (625 - 200)
= Rs. 425.
Gain in 1 year = Rs.425/2  = Rs. 212.50.
Daniel Radcliffe calculated his average over the last 24 class tests and found it to be 76. He finds out that the marks for three tests have been inverted by mistake. The correct marks for these tests are 87, 98 and 79. What is the approximate percentage difference between his incorrect average and his actual average?
	No change 11 12 13
	Incorrect value is: 78, 97, 89
Correct values are: 87, 79, 98
Difference between the sum of the correct and incorrect value is = (78 + 97 + 89) - (87 + 79 + 98) = 0
Thus, there won’t be any change
# Ed can do a piece of work in 8 hours. Edd can do the same work in 10 hours, Eddy can do the same work in 12 hours. Ed, Edd and Eddy start the same work at 9 am, while Ed stops at 11 a.m., the remaining two complete the work. At what time(approx) will the work get completed?
Let the total work = 120 units.
As Ed completes this entire work in 8 hours, his capacity is 15 units /hour.
Similarly, the capacity of Edd is 12 units / hour.
The capacity of Eddy is 10 units / hour.
All 3 started at 9 am and worked upto 11 am. 
So, total work done upto 11 am = 2 x (15 + 12 + 10) = 74.
Remaining work = 120 - 74 = 46.
Now this work is to be done by Edd and Eddy = 46 / (12 + 10) = 2 hours (approx)
So, the work gets completed at 1 pm.
# In a conference meeting 6 male officials & 4 female officials have to be seated in a row given that no two ladies can sit together. How many different arrangements are there, if there are a total of 13 chairs?
Let us first sit all the 6 men in 6 positions in 6! ways.  
Now there are 7 gaps between them in which 4 women can sit in 7P4 ways.
So, total ways are 6! x 7P4
# Karan and Arjun start from house at 10 am. They travel from their house on the MG road at 20 kmph and 40 kmph. There is a Junction on their path. Karan turns left at junction at 12 : 00 noon, Arjun reaches junction earlier, and turns right. Both of them continue to travel till 2 p.m. What is the distance between Karan and Arjun at 2 p.m.?
Distance between House and  junction = 20 x 2 = 40 km.
i.e., Arjun reached junction at 11 am.
Arjun continued to right after 11 am and traveled upto 2.
So, distance covered by him = 3 x 40 = 120 km.
Karan reached junction at 12 noon and traveled upto 2
So, distanced traveled by him = 2 x 20 = 40 km.
Thus, the total distance between them = 120 + 40 = 160 km
# Joseph takes twice as much time as James or thrice as much time as Jacob to finish a piece of work. Working together, they can finish the work in 2 days. James can do the work alone in:
Suppose Joseph, James and Jacob take x, x/2 and x/3  hours respectively to finish the work. 
Then work done in 1 day, [1/x + 2/x + 3/x ] = 1/2
6/x  = 1/2.
x = 12.
So, James takes 6 days to finish the work.
# Two pipes A and B together can fill a tank in 18 hours. If A alone takes 1/2 of the time of thrice B’s time, then the time taken by B alone to fill the tank is:
Suppose B alone takes X hours to fill the tank.
Then, A takes = 1/2 of 3X = 3X/2 hours.
Now, B’s 1 hours work = 1/X and A’s 1 hours work = 2/3X.
Given that, (A + B) takes = 18 hours.
Then (A + B)’s 1 hour’s work = 1/18.
Therefore, 1/18 = 1/X + 2/3X.
5/3X = 1/18
X = 30.
Hence, B takes 30 hrs to fill the tank alone.
# If an equilateral triangle and a square has an equal face of 12 inches. Find the quantitative relation between their areas.
Area of a square with side a = a2
Here, a = 12 inches then a2 = 144
Area of an equilateral triangle with side b = (sqrt3)(b2)/4.
Here, b = 12 inches then (sqrt3)(b2)/4 = (sqrt3)(144)/4 = 36(sqrt3)
 
Now, the required relation = Area of the square / Area of the triangle

 = 144 / [(sqrt3)36] =  4/sqrt3.
 # In AMCAT Sardarji was asked to find the average of some numbers. By using the average 51(2/3) of P, Q and R, he found 6 values P, Q, R, P + Q, Q + R and R + P. Find the average of all the seven values.
 Given that, average of P, Q, R = 51 2/3 = 155/3
i.e., (P + Q + R ) / 3 = 155/3
Then, P + Q + R = 155.
 Average of seven values = (P + Q + R + P + Q + R + P + Q + Q + R + R + P) / 7
 # My new wrist-watch makes a beep sound, in every hour, as many as the time it shows. Find how many beeps the watch will make in a day?
 The wall clock makes 1 beep when it shows time 1.
It makes 2 beeps when it shows time 2.
Similarly, it makes 12 beeps when the time is 12.
Then the total number of beeps = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 12
1, 2, 3,...12 is series of natural numbers from 1 to 12. Hence totally 12 terms.
We know that, the sum of n natural numbers is [n(n+1)]/2= (12*13)/2 = 78
That is, it makes 78 beeps in 12 hours.
Since a day has 24 hours, then the required number of beeps = 2 x 78 = 156.
= [(P + Q + R) + (P + Q + R) + (P + Q + R) + (P + Q + R)] / 7.
= [155 + 155 + 155 + 155 ] / 7
= 620 / 7 = 88.57
Hence, the required average is 88.57
