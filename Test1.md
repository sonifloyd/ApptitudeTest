Q8. A man travelled a distance of 61 km in 9 hours. He travelled partly on foot at 4 km/hr and partly on bicycle at 9 km/hr.
What is the distance travelled on foot? 
 12 km
 14 km

 18 km
 None of these
Solution:


Q9. The distance travelled by a train is 1830 km. The speed of the train is one more (numerically) than 
twice the time taken to travel the distance. What will be the respective ratio of the speed of the train and 
time taken to travel? 
 30 : 61
ans  61 : 30
 25 : 51
 51 : 25
 none of these.
Solution:
total diatance=1830km
by question
speed=2*time+1
speed*time=1830



Q10. A boat takes 9 hr to travel a distance upstream and takes 3 hr to travel the same distance downstream. 
If the speed of the boat in still water is 4 kmph, then what is the velocity of the stream? 
 4 kmph
 3 kmph
 6 kmph
 2 kmph
 none of these.
Solution:
distance is equal
so upstrem distance = downstrem distance
(speed of boat in still water -speed of stream)*time=speed of boat in still water +speed of stream)*time
 (ukm/h-vkm/h)*9=(u+v)*3
 v=2km/h
