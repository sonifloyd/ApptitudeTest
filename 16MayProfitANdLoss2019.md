# Q7. A shopkeeper has 80 kg pure sugar. He mixes a certain quantity of salt (in kg) in it and made profit
of 25% by selling the mixture at its cost price. If cost price of pure sugar was Rs. 24 per kg then how much amount
of salt the shopkeeper mixed to the pure sugar (Assume cost of salt to be zero)? 
 10 kg
 25 kg
 20 kg
 24 kg
 40 kg
Solution:
suppose amt of salt =xkg
s.p of mixture=(80+x)*24
c.p of pure sugar=80*24
s.p-c.p/c.p*100=profit
(80+x)*24-80*24=25
x=20kg
