# Ritesh and Co. generated revenue of Rs. 1,250 in 2006. This was 12.5% of its gross revenue. 
In 2007, the gross revenue grew by Rs. 2,500. What is the percentage increase in the revenue in 2007?
A.	12.5 %
B.	20 %
C.	25%// ans

suppose gross revenue =x
x*12.5/100=1250
x=10000
% increase = 2500 *100/10000=25%
# A thief steals a car and drives it at 15 km/hr. The theft has been discovered after one hour and 
the owner of the car sets off in another car at 25 km/hr. When will the owner overtake the thief from the starting point?
A.	1 hr
B.	1.5 hr
C.	2 hr
D.	3 hr
Explanation :

Distance covered by the thief in one hour = 15 km

Now this distance is to be covered by the relative speed of (25−15)=10 km/hr

Hence, time required to cover this distance at a speed of 10 km/hr: 

=>10/15.

=>1.5 hr.
# At a profit of 20% the selling price of an article is Rs 180. If the profit is increased by Rs 30, 
what is the new percentage profit?
A.	30%
B.	40%
C.	35%
D.	None of these
Explanation :
Cost price = 180(100/(100+20)) = (180/120)100 = Rs 150.

Now,  profit = 20% of 150 + 30 = 30 = Rs 60.

So, the new percentage profit = (60/150)*100 = 40%.
# The retail price of a water geyser is Rs. 1265. The manufacturer gains 10%, the wholesale dealer  15% and 
the retailer gains 25%, then the cost of the product is 
A.	Rs. 800
B.	Rs. 900
C.	Rs. 600
D.	Rs. 700
Explanation :
Let the cost of the product be Rs. p.
Then, 

=> p x (110/100) x (115p/100) x (125p/100) = 1265.
=> p= 1265 x 100/110 x 100/115 x 100/125 = Rs. 800.

# What percent selling price would be 34% of the cost price of the product, if the gross profit is 26% of the selling price?
A.	25.16%
B.	74.00%
C.	17.16%
D.	88.40%
Explanation :
Let the selling price be Rs. 100, then profit = Rs. 26.
Therefore, Cost price = 100 – 26 = 74.
Therefore, the required per cent = (34% of 74)% = 25.16%.
(as we assumed the selling price to be 100, the percentage we obtain above is actually the part of the
selling price equal to 34% of the cost price of the product).

# 15 liters of a mixture contains 20% alcohol and rest water. If 3 liters of water is added in it, per cent
of alcohol in the new mixture will be?
A.	17.57%
B.	16.67%
C.	15.32%
D.	14.21%
Explanation :
Alcohol in the mixture = 15 x 15 = 3 litres
Mixture becomes (15 + 3) litres = 18 litres on adding 3 litres of water.
Therefore, Percentage of alcohol in the new mixture = 318=16 = 16.67%
# Ratio of Ashok's age to Pradeep's age is equal to 4:3.  Ashok will be 26 years old after 6 years. How old is Pradeep now?
A.	13 years
B.	14 years
C.	12 years
D.	15 years
Explanation :

Ashok's present age = (26-6) = 20 years.
Pradeep's present age = 20 x 3/4  = 15 years

# A man sitting in train travelling at the rate of 50 km/hr observes that it takes 9 sec for a goods train 
travelling in the opposite direction to pass him. If the goods train is 187.5m long. Find its speed
A.	40 km/hr
B.	30 km/hr
C.	24 km/hr
D.	25 km/hr
Explanation :
Let the speed of goods train be x km/hr.
Then, (50+x)×(5/18) = 187.5  / 9.

=>  x= 25 km/hr.


# The proportion between the current ages of A and B is 6:7. If B is 4 years elder than A, what will be the proportion of the ages of A and B after 4 years?
A.	2:3
B.	7:8
C.	3:4
D.	5:6
Explanation :
If A’s age and B’s age = 6a and 7a years respectively
Then B is 4 years elder than A
=> 7a – 6a = 4
A = 4
After 4 years, A’s age = 6a + 4 years
And B’s age = 7a + 4
Needed ratio  = 6a + 4 : 7a + 4
Replace “a” with  4, then 
= 28 : 32
= 7 : 8

# Ayesha's father was 38 years of age when she was born while her mother was 36 years old when her brother four years 
younger to her was born. What is the difference between the ages of her parents?

A.	
2 years

B.	
4 years

C.	
6 years

D.	
8 years

Explanation :
Mother's age when Ayesha's brother was born = 36 years.

Father's age when Ayesha's brother was born = (38 + 4) years = 42 years.

Therefore, Required difference = (42 - 36) years = 6 years.

# If two times of the daughter’s age in years is included to the mother’s age, the total is 70 and if two times of the mother’s age is included to the daughter’s age, the total is 95. So the Mother’s age is,
A.	30
B.	38
C.	40
D.	41
Explanation :
Let daughter’s age = A and mother’s age = B.
Given :-

=> 2A+B = 70.                               --------------(i)

and, 

=> A+2B = 95.                              ---------------(ii)
Solving both the equations for B, we will get B = 40.

# A and B are children of D. Who is the father of A? To answer this question which of the statements (1) and (2) is necessary?

C is the brother of A and the son of E.
F is the mother B.
A.	
Only (1)

B.	
Only (2)

C.	
Either (1) or (2)

D.	
(1) and (2) both

Explanation :
A and B are children of D.

From (1), C is the brother B and son of E.

Since, the sex of D and E are not known. Hence (1) is not sufficient to answer the question.

From (2). F is the mother of B. Hence, F is also the mother of A. Hence D is the father of A.

Thus, (2) is sufficient to answer the question.
