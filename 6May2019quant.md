# Today it is Thursday.After 132 days,it will be
Since each day of the week is repeated after 7 days.
After 133 days,it will be thursday.
So one day before that would be Wednesday
# A train 120 meters long is running with a speed of 60 km/hr. 
In what time will it pass a boy who is running at 6 km/hr in the direction opposite to that in which the train is going?
Speed of train relative to boy= `(60 + 6)` km/hr = 66 km/hr
= [66 xx 5/18]` m/sec = `[55/3]` m/sec.
Time taken to pass the boy=` [120 xx 3/55]` sec = 6.54 seconds
# Devesh can cover a certain distance in 1 hour 24 minutes by covering two-third of the distance at 6 km/hour and the 
rest at 7 km/hr. Calculate total distance.
Let the total distance be x , then

`[{(2/3) x }/6 ] + [{(1/3) x }/7 ] = 7/5`

`=> x/9 + x/21 = 7/5`

`=> 7x = 63`

`=> x = 9`

# Find the H.C.F, if the numbers are in the ratio of 4 : 5 : 6 and their L.C.M. is 2400.
Let the numbers be 3x, 4x and 5x.

Then,their L.C.M. = 120x.

So, 120x = 2400 or x = 20.

=>The numbers are (4 x 20), (5 x 20) and (6 x 20).

Hence, required H.C.F = 20.
# What is the value of c , If 8 is 4% of a, and 4 is 8% of b. c equals b/a.
Let be the 4% of a is 4a/100.

Since this equals 8, we have 4a/100=8.

Solving for a yields a=8×`(100/4)`=200.

Also, 8% of b equals 8b/100, and this equals 4. 

Hence, we have `(8/100)`×b=4. 

Solving for b yields  b = 50.

Now, c=`b/a`=`50/200`=`1/4.`
# P and Q take part in 100 m race. P runs at 6kmph. P gives Q a start of 8 m and still beats him by 8 seconds. 
The speed of Q is:
speed =( 6**5/18)m/sec) = (30/18) m/sec`

Time taken by P to cover 100 m = `(100 ** 18/30)`m/sec =60 sec

Time taken by Q to cover 92 m = (60 + 8) = 68 sec.

Q's speed =`("Distance"/"Time"**18/5) kmph =(92/68 ** 18/5)` kmph = 4.86kmp
# The rate at which a sum becomes four times of itself in 25 years at S.I.,will be:
important to note here is that simple interest will be 3x not 4x, beause 3x+x = 4x
Let sum = x. Then, S.I. = 3x

Rate = `[100 ** (S.I.) / P**T] %`

= `[100 ** (3x) / x ** 25]% = 12%`
