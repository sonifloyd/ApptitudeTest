Certain words/phrases have been printed in bold to help you locate them.

Our universities are changing. Never has the pace of change been this fast, nor the protests this loud.
On the rare occasion that the media take notice, the discussion usually focusses on whether or not due procedure has been 
followed. Given our authoritarian power structures, it is as important to ask whether adequate thought has gone into the 
initiation of the changes. Teachers of the University of Delhi are especially familiar with changes; the recent spate began 
with the introduction of the semester system in undergraduate teaching in 2011. Although there are certain serious logistical 
issues involved, there is nothing inherently wrong with teaching in a semester mode. What is problematic is when the
introduction of the system is done in a manner in which little attention is paid to the content of semester courses. 
Unfortunately, these courses were created by snipping the existing annual courses in half, sometimes badly. Why? There
was no time to reflect on curricular or pedagogic issues.
More recently, we saw even more radical changes with the introduction of the four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP)
in the University of Delhi. There is nothing inherently good or bad about a four-year BA programme. A great deal hinges
on the quality of the courses that form the programme. Of course, questions can be asked about whether a single university 
in the country can move to a four-year system and the implications of an additional year’s education in a country where many 

students find it difficult to pay even the highly subsidised fees. Anyhow, the programme was introduced in 2013, again 
without adequate time to think seriously about curricular or pedagogic issues. And then, in the summer of 2014, it was 
just as suddenly withdrawn. The University of Delhi is still reeling under the impact of all these changes, but what is
now on the cards is something even more worrying; something that will affect not one but all Indian universities. 
A communiqué? from the University Grants Commission (UGC) dated November 14, 2014, gives certain directives that were 
apparently discussed at a retreat of the vice chancellors of Central universities on September 12 and 13, 2014; these 
were subsequently approved by the Ministry of Human Resource Development. The directives require that all universities 
follow a Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) from 2015 onwards. We are told that the aim is to provide choice to students
within an institution as well as “seamless mobility across institutions” in India and abroad by adopting a “cafeteria
approach”. These guidelines are apparently supposed to apply to all undergraduate and postgraduate level degree, diploma 
and certificate programmes being run by Central, State and deemed universities in India. Once again: such sweeping change, 
so little thought.

There would have been no problem if the new system only involved giving students grades instead of marks. However, it gives 
an all-India scale of conversion of marks into grades which does not take into account the fact that there are radical 
differences between the “standard” in different colleges and universities. But even this is only a small part of a larger 
package that has very serious implications for the autonomy of universities and the quality of university education across
the country.
All universities are to have a uniform structure of syllabi. There will be “core” courses, “compulsory foundation” courses
, 
and “elective foundation courses” that “are value-based and are aimed at man-making education”. This seems to be the FYUP
in a new three-year, all-India garb. In the new system, in at least half of the core courses, the assessment will be based 
on examinations in which external examiners will set and mark the papers. The new system will also have an impact on PhD 
programmes. Theses must be evaluated by external as well as internal examiners. In the University of Delhi, while 
undergraduate examination papers are currently marked by teachers from across the university, postgraduate assessment 
is done within the departments. In the History Department, we currently have three external examiners for PhD theses.
The new diktat is set to change all this. No say in courses It gets worse. It is now clear that the new system also aim
s 
at introducing uniform syllabi across universities in the country. The website of the UGC displays model undergraduate 
syllabi for various subjects, from which only minimal deviation will be permitted. It does not specify where these syllabi 
have come from. The History syllabus on the UGC website happens to be the syllabus of the University of Delhi, with a
mishmash of elements drawn from the old FYUP syllabus. This is the “chosen one” which will presumably be imposed on 
universities all over the country.

This is not in the least bit flattering. In normal times, the process of syllabus revision in our University has 
involved wide-ranging consultation and discussion among all the teachers involved. It takes time — sometimes too much 
— but it is worth it. For example, the MA History syllabus was revised a few years ago, and the History Department has 
recently initiated a revision of its BA syllabi, because teachers are convinced that these syllabi need to be changed
and improved. Now it seems that we need not bother. Our old courses, with which we are dissatisfied, will continue and 
will be imposed not only on us, but on other universities in the country. In the best universities in the world,
postgraduate courses represent cutting-edge approaches and research, and are tailored to the research expertise of 


its teachers. The uniqueness of the profiles of departments and universities rests, to a great extent, on this. But 
this will no longer be possible, will not be allowed, in our universities. We teachers will no longer have a role in 
designing the courses that we teach.

The changes that are envisaged in the new system are much more far-reaching in scope and scale than the recently 
jettisoned FYUP. But in both cases, we see an attempt to bring about radical change in a hasty manner without adequate 
thought about the rationale and logistics, and even less time devoted to what matters the most — the actual content of 
courses. Many universities have already fallen in line and have embraced the Choice Based Credit System, and others will 
no doubt follow suit. Instead of uniform excellence, the result will be uniform mediocrity and a lowering of the academic 
standards of our best institutions. Given the enormous logistical problems involved in introducing too much change too fast,
it could also involve a breakdown of our university system.
