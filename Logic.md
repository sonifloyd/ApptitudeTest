# Arrange the words given below in a logical sequence:
a.Attempt b. arrear c. Sem exam d. degree e. result f. pass
At first a student writes his Sem exam an then the results are declared. further he comes to know whether he 
has got an arrear or not. If he has got an an arrear, he is given another attempt to pass the paper. 
And then finally he is given his degree certificate. So the logical sequence is c, e, b, a, f, d.

	None of these
 # How many pairs of letters in the word ‘GRACEFUL’ have 
  as many letters between them in the word as in the alphabet order (Moving Forward)?
  The pairs of letters thus formed are E, F.

L & R cannot form because it cannot move backward!
# How long will it take for two pipes P and Q to fill an empty tank if they work alternately for an hour each? 
I.Working alone, Pipe P can fill the tank in 5 hours
II.Pipe Q is one fourth as efficient as Pipe P
Working alone, Pipe P can fill the tank in 5 hours.
Pipe B is one fourth as efficient as Pipe Q. 
So, pipe Q takes 20 hours to fill the tank. Total time taken depends on the capacity of the tank and on which pipe starts first.
So, the question cannot be answered on the basis of the two statements.
# There are 10 animals, 2 each of cheetah, tiger, leopard, monkey and chimpanzee in a zoo. The enclosures in the zoo are named A, B, C, D, E and each of enclosure is allotted to one of the following attendants-Shalyn, Jiggy, Sumaiya, Renie, Malini. 2 animals of different species are housed in each enclosure. A leopard and tiger cannot be together. A cheetah cannot be with a tiger or a monkey. Sumaiya attends to animals from among monkey, tiger, chimpanzee and cheetah only. Malini attends to a leopard and Cheetah. Jiggy does not attend to tiger, leopard or monkey. A, B, C are allotted to Malini, Jiggy and Renie respectively. A and D enclosures have one animal of the same species. C and E have the same pair of animals. The animals attended by Shalyn are 
final arrangement is made based on the information given above and seeing the table we conclude the answers.
Mali(Leo,chee,a) ji(Chim,chee,B),Renie(tiger,Mon,C),Sh(leo,Chim,D),Sum(Tiger,Monkey,E)

Thus, based on the table, we can say that Shalyn attends Leopard and Chimpanzee.
# 5 persons with names A, B, C, D, E live separately in any of the following hut, fort, house, hotel or palace. Each one likes 2 different colours from among the following: blue, black, red, yellow, green. C likes red and blue. D likes black. The person living in palace does not like black and blue, A likes blue and red. B likes yellow. E lives in hotel. B lives in a
C likes red and blue.
D likes black.
A likes blue and red.
B likes yellow.
E stays in a hotel.
We can see that other than B,everybody likes either black or blue.
E already stays in hotel.
So B stays in palace.
# At 6 : 45 PM, Rajesh is facing north-west. He turns 450 clockwise whenever his clock strikes the hour (for e.g. at 1 AM, 2 AM, 3 AM,..). He turns  900  anticlockwise whenever his clock strikes the half-hour (for e.g, at 1. 30 PM, 2.30 PM,...). What direction is Rajesh facing at 11.15 PM on the same day?
The number of times the clock strikes the hour between 6.45 PM and 11:15 PM.
= 5 (at 7 PM, 8 PM, 9 PM, 10 PM, 11 PM).
This corresponds to a total clockwise return of 5 x 45 = 225o
The number of times the clock strikes the half-hour between 6 : 45 and 11:15 PM.
= 4 (at 7 : 30 PM, 8 : 30 PM, 9 : 30 PM, 10 : 30 PM).
This corresponds to a total anticlockwise turn of 4 x 90 = 360o.
360o can be neglected (since a rotation by 360o always ends up in the same direction).
Thus, he has effectively turned clockwise by 225o.Since he was facing northwest originally, he must be finally facing south.
# Supriye says "I have as many sisters as brothers". Harika says,"Each of us sisters has only half as many sisters as brothers". Assuming that Supriye and Harika are brother and sister, how many brothers and sisters are there in the family?
Supriye says "I have as many sisters as brothers".
Thus, if there are b brothers and s sisters in all, then b - 1 = s.
Similarly, Harika says "Each of us sisters has only half as many sisters as brothers".
Thus, b = 2(s - 1)
Thus, the only combination that satisfies both the equations is b = 4 and s = 3.
# Mukul went in his car to meet his friend John. He Drove 30 kms towards north and then 40 kms towards west. He then turned to south and covered 8 kms. Further he turned to east and moved 26 kms. Finally he turned right and drove 10 kms and then turned left to travel 19 kms. How far and in which direction is he from the starting point?
North East of starting point, 13 km

# Directions : There are only four members of a family viz., P, Q, R, S and there is only one couple among them. When asked about their relationships, following were their replies:
P: Q is my son. S is my mother.
Q: R is my wife. S is my father.
R: S is my mother – in – law. P is my daughter.
S: P is my grand – daughter. Q is my daughter – in – law
Who gives detailed information about the relationship among all the four?
none
# Find the odd one out:55, 94, 422, 248, 723
5*5=25
9*4=36
4*2*2=16
2*4*8=64
7*2*3=42
42 is not a perfect square
So 723 is the odd one out
# David’s father proposed to give him pocket money in a very peculiar manner. There was a bowl in which he used to put Rs. 8 at the beginning of every day and David was supposed to take half the amount present in the bowl at the end of every day. Three days later, after day-end, it turned out that there were Rs. 20 left in the bowl. How much pocket money did Nirmit get for these three days in all?
There were Rs.20 in the bowl after day-end on the third day.
Since David was supposed to take half the amount in the bowl, David must have taken Rs.20 on the third day.
This means that there must have been Rs.40 in the bowl on the third day, out of which Rs.8 were added by David’s father. 
Hence, before that, there must be 40 - 8 = Rs.32 in the bowl after 2 days. Hence, David must have taken Rs.32 on the second day as pocket money. This means that there were Rs.64 in the bowl on the second day after David’s father added RS.8 to it. Hence, at the end of the first day there must be 64 - 8 = Rs.56  in the bowl. Hence, David must have taken Rs.56 on the first day as his pocket money. 
So, the total amount of money David took in 3 days as pocket money = 56 + 32 + 20 = Rs.108.
# A lizard wants to reach the top of a 10 feet wall. It starts from the bottom and climbs 2 feet in an hour. Exhausted, it hangs there for the next 5 hours and sleeps. Every time it sleeps, it slips 1 foot backwards. How many hours will it take for it to reach the top of the wall?
The lizard climbs 2 feet every hour and then slips backwards by 1 foot in the next 5 hours. Hence, in 6 hours, the lizard climbs 1 foot. Hence, in 48 hours it will climb 8 feet. Then in the next 1 hour,it will climb 2 feet and reach the top of the wall.Hence the total time taken by the lizard to reach the top of the wall is 49 hours.
# In a row of boys, Sangeet is 5th from the left and Kavitha is 33rd from the right. If they interchange their positions, Sangeet becomes 25th from the left. How many boys are there in the row?
When Sangeet comes to this place, he becomes 25th from left.
Thus, the 25th place from the left is same as the 33rd place from the right.
So, the total number of boys in the row.
= position of Kavitha from left + position of Kavitha from right - 1.
= 25 + 33 - 1
= 57
# Three actresses were asked their age in an interview. But since they didn’t want the public to know their age, one of the smart actresses, Shriya put forward a puzzle in front of the journalists. She said that she was the youngest unless Madhuri is, and that if Trisha isn’t the youngest then she was the eldest. Who was the actress who is neither the youngest, nor the eldest?
Shriya was the youngest unless Madhuri is.
This means that Shriya was the youngest among the three only in case Madhuri was not.
Hence, either Shriya or Madhuri have to be the youngest.
The next statement states that if Trisha isn’t the youngest (which she is not).
Shriya is the eldest.
Hence, the youngest actress can only be Madhuri.
The actress who is neither the youngest nor the eldest is Trisha.
# In a row of boys Lalitha is 14th from the left and Fatima is 21st from the right. When they both interchange their position, Fatima becomes 35th from the right. What is the position of Lalitha from left after interchanging positions?
	Before interchanging their positions Lalitha is 14th from left and Fatima is 21st from right

After interchanging their positions Fathima will be becomes 35th from right.
28 left
total no of people 13+1+34=48
# In a row of 26 boys when Rajesh was shifted by six places towards the right, he became the 15th person from the left end. What was his earlier position from the right end of the row?
Original position of Rajesh from the left =15 - 6 = 9th
Thus there were originally 8 people to  his left.
Hence, his earlier position from right end is 25 - 8+1 = 18th
# In a certain code language if “UPLIFT” is coded as “252” and “XMAS” is coded as “171”, then how is the word “MERRY” coded in that language?
The position of each letter of this word in the alphabet is 21, 16, 12, 9, 6, 20.
The sum of these positions is 21 + 16 + 12 + 9 + 6 + 20 = 84
Now, 252 = 84 × 3.
Similarly, Consider the word ‘XMAS’.
The position of each letter of this word in the alphabet is 24, 13, 1, 19.
The sum of these positions is 24 + 13 + 1 + 19 = 57.
Now, 171 = 57 × 3.
Similarly, applying this logic to MERRY.
We get 237.
# If in a certain language J is coded as 110, E as 30, S as 380, U as 462, then how is the word LOVE coded in this language?
	Here position of J in the alphabet is 10 and it is coded as 10 × 11 = 110
Position of E in the alphabet is 5 and it is coded as 5 × 6 = 30
All the other codes given also follow the same logic.
Thus, in this language, if the position of a letter in the alphabet is n, then each letter is coded as n × (n + 1)
Applying this coding system, the code obtained for LOVE is 15624050630.
# In a certain coding system, the word ‘water’ is coded as 2324444967. Then how will the word ‘wine’ be coded in the same system?
he position of the individual letters in the alphabet for the word ‘water’ is 23, 1, 20, 5,18.
Hence, the position of the first alphabet is used as the first number. 
The sum of the first and second position (23 + 1 = 24) is used as the second number in the code.
Similarly, the sum of the second and third position (24 + 20 = 44) is used as the third number and 44 + 5 = 49 is used as the fourth number.
Applying this coding system, the code obtained for ‘wine’ 23324651
# Five friends: Ajith, Bala, Charan, Deena and Glady had recently written a high school examination. The following statements are known about their results:
I. Ajith did not secure 1st rank. Bala did not secure 2nd rank.
II. Deena did not secure 2nd rank. Glady did not secure 3rd rank.
III. Charan had secured a rank among top three. Deena did not secure rank among top three.
IV.Ajith had secured rank among top three. Charan did not secure rank among top three.
V. Deena had secured rank among top three. Glady had secured rank among top three.
In each of the five statements above one statement is true and the other one is false, not necessarily in that order.
Who among the following secured 3rd rank?
Statements 3 and 4 contain contradictory statements regarding Charan securing a rank among top three. Hence, this is a good starting point for assumption. 
Assuming Charan had secured a rank among top three would imply that the second part in statement 3 would be false.
So, Deena would then have secured a rank among top three.
From statement 4 since the second part of statement would be false,it implies that the first part of the statement has to be true.
So Ajith must have secured a rank among the top three.
Hence, as per the assumption, Ajith, Charan and Deena should be in top three while Banu and Glady should not.
From statement 5 : The first part would then be true thereby leading to conclusion that Glady did not secure rank among top three.
From statement 2 : The second part has to be false,implying that the first part has to be true and hence it was Deena who must have secured 2nd rank.
From statement 1 : Since Deena had secured 2nd rank it implies that the second part of the statement is true thereby leading to conclusion that the first part is false and so Ajith must have secured 1st rank.
Since Ajith, Deena and Charan are in top three, Charan secured 3rd rank.
Who among the following had secured 1st rank?
